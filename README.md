# ClearSkies - OOP Project Group 61

## Project
A Java program to track your CO<sub>2</sub> consumption and compete with your friends to save the environment!

## Installing/running
Open the client and server projects seperately. Then run the client and server like this:  
- For the server: For the fist time, run `mvn clean install` using the terminal. After that you can start the sever by running `com.group61.server.ServerApplication.java`.  
- For the client: For the fist time, run `mvn clean install exec:java` using the terminal. Any other time you can simply use `mvn compile exec:java`. To skip tests, add `-DskipTests` to the command. To skip checkstyle, add `-Dcheckstyle.skip` to the command. Always run the full `mvn clean install exec:java` command before committing.

A working internet connection is required. for both the server and the client.

#### Personal Development Plan
##### Strong points
- Determined: When I set a goal all my actions are aimed towards 
achieving that goal
- Team worker: I enjoy working in teams, and not only enjoy it but 
I try to make it productive by checking on my teammates, discussing with them and asking help.
##### Weak points
- Blinded by the current activity: This is a consequence for my first 
strong point. When I'm working on something I lose focus of my 
surroundings and that could mean that I only work on one thing 
and forget other things. That could effect the working of others.
- Weak on documentation and business side: When working on projects
I find it much easier to program and work rather than think about 
what needs to be done and plan what's best for the project.

##### Goal
During this project there are many goals that I have in mind. In the past I have worked
on different projects with many people and I always notice that
mostly the hardest part is coordinating between team members to reach the highest
potential that we have. But I find that quite challenging which is why 
I'm going to try with different approaches. It is very helpful that we are working in 
scrum fashion because that increases productivity and it is also important in real life for work.
Also professionally this project I would like to develop my hard skills.
Java is quite a powerful language and I am already on a good level so with this project
I wish to get better and learn how to apply my knowledge to create something that can be used
in real life situations. Personally I am really interested in back-end development so I am
going to discuss with my team mates to see if I can be working on that.
I also want to actively think with my teammates about the project
and make development decisions after thinking about the business part.


##### Reality
I am currently working part time at company and I'm doing things 
similar to this project. I'm also trying to adapt to the scrum 
working methology.


##### Options 
My options are what I can do within my team and with the help of the TA.
I can ask help from teammates whenever I'm stuck and I can ask for
their opinions on matters that I don't understand. I can also use some
of my working time to research new libraries and technologies so that
I can grow my skills.

##### Will
I am going to devote enough time for the project so that I'm an active
team member. I will try to offer my help if my teammates need it and ask 
help of my teammates in case I need it.

### Personal development plan
One of my strong points is that I can focus clearly for couple hours on one problem, trying to find new solutions how to solve it. As an example I can take a question from Algorithms and Datastructures course where one implementation question took me 2 hours to understand, and then 3 hours to get my ideas into the weblab, and it worked. 

Another strong point I have, is also my weak point to some extent. I would like to understand what I am doing completely before I start coding. So, as an example I would mention web development assignment, where we had to make a game. It took me around 2 weeks to just analyse the example game, and create a plan of how I could ever structure my project. But after that, I could quickly enough figure out how to write what I need, so I basically had the same progress as if I was working every week, instead of analyzing.

In a team, it would be easier for me to focus on a specific problem. So if there is a deadline, I will make everything to stick to it not to miss anything. The goals of this project would be easier to achieve with the team, because then I would understand the conceptual things faster, by working in a team. Things become much easier when you work not alone, but more in a group of other people, so all the knowledge can be combined.

My weakest point as I think is that I don't have much programming experience before, like some people do. This is not shown in conceptual things, because I know Pascal to some extent, but more in new things, that require me to understand the way how the computer itself works, and memory inside of it. I hope it won't be reflected on the project much, because I already gained some knowledge since September about Java, so it is now all about effort.

Another weaker point I have is that I am lazy, and an example of it would be how I did my web development assignment: I did it in the last 2 weeks, and right before the time I had an exam I was busy with the assignment, because I had to submit it in 30 minutes. But this does not influence my responsibility, so I would never miss a deadline in this project.

#### G - Goal
My goal is first of all to get a passing grade for this course. Also my goals are to learn how to work with git, especially in a group and to learn some new concepts in java. Especially I would like to know how to do the GUI. I will succeed all of them by the end of the course, I hope. Maybe I would succeed with git in the week 5 of this quarter, because now I am not used to it.
#### R - Reality
Yes, I already did some research on how to create an https server in java, how to use JSON, how link a database, etc. Not going to say this is completely clear to me, but I will give it a try later on, trying to understand everything in more details on practice.
#### O - Options
To achieve any goal in this life, we need to work as hard as we can. This is also related to this project, so I can achieve any of my goals just by doing a lot of work in a team and by developing my own skills.
#### W - Will
Right now I can just plan what I am going to do during the next week, so I can start making research during this weekend. We can create an action plan with concrete steps, but this is going to happen during our second meeting. For now we just decided to make a research about libraries we can use, and techniques we can apply to make the project successful.

#### Personal development plan
My strong points are that I’m willing to learn and explore my potential when it comes to programming and working in an environment such as Git. I’d also like to become better at communicating with others and working with them in a team project.
The weaker points of mine are that I don’t have a lot of experience with programming, since I only started doing since the start of this study. I’m also somewhat shy, which is why is feel uncomfortable with being in a position of leadership. Hopefully I will become better at that in the future.

##### Goals
My goals are to use all the experience which I will get from the project to become better at Java, being able to comfortably use Git, but also establishing connections with my team members in order to communicate better.

##### Reality
I didn’t have any prior experience with programming before doing the CSE study. Therefor it’s important for me to do well in the project itself in order to improve. Only by keeping practicing will I achieve this.

##### Options
In order to achieve my goals I will have to do my best, even if the majority of people have more experience than me. By practicing a lot I will hopefully get a better understanding of the items listed in my Goal section.

##### Will
In order to achieve my goals I will have to work hard right from the get-go. If I get stuck or don’t know what to do I hope one of my teammates will be able to help me out or give me suggestions on what I could improve on, as I could learn a lot from them.

#### Personal development plan
What I am good at:
I am quite experienced with JAVA and how to connect it to a Non relational databases like Firebase since i have programmed some Android applications that had the same requirements as this project.

What I am not good at:
I am definetely not good at finding the right words to sum things up. As well I am pretty bad at finding a good design.

##### Goals
For me it is a goal to get used to bigger projects like this and how these are structured/organized. I also would like to improve my development skills (Backend and Frontend). The most important skill that I would like to get from this project is how to work in a group of multiple developers.

##### Reality
I can not tell yet.

##### Options
One option is to split up tasks and work on it indivdually. That is the best way to work I think, splitting up serveral smaller fatures to not get in conflict with others code. We should meet up quite often though, to be able to discuss  topics that occur while working on the project.

##### Will
I am going to work on this project as much as I can to get a high grade and really am looking forward to create a stunning product.

### Ricardo Vogel

#### Personal development plan
Two of my strong points are management and front-end development (and design). Although I would say I'm already good at these things, I would like to use them more in this project to further my skills. A good example for both skills is a personal project of mine, called [heartfuck](https://heartfuck.github.io/), a brainfuck like programming language. Although only two people worked on the project (plus two others who made small or seperate contributions), I did completely set up the GitHub with things like issues and projects (boards on GitLab). The website is a good example of front-end development. Of course making a website is different from making a program in Java. I think I can learn a lot from doing that.  

Weaker points of mine are servers and databases. Back-end development isn't really my thing. I can make things work, but I have a hard time making them work efficiently. Even though I would like to learn to do this correctly, but I don't think it'll be a good idea to give me these tasks.    

##### Goals
My goal for this project is to learn more about how to work in a team. This includes planning and git. I would also like to more about front-end development. Grade wise, I'm aiming for something high. If we have the time, I would like us to add some additional features. I would also like to get as many points for the process, not only for the grade, but also because it's an important skill to have.

##### Reality
Before coming to TU Delft, I had programmed a lot in my free time. Most of this was game development in Unity with C#, but I also did some Python and web development. Like I already mentioned, I already use git a lot.  

##### Options
In my opinion, the best way to learn is by practicing a lot. For the management side, I'd like to really make use of the issues and boards. I would also like to work on the front-end to learn more about that. Reading through the merge requests from others can also be useful, but of course it's not as good as making things yourself. Helping other groupmembers out when they can't figure something out by themselves can also be extremely useful. The same goes for asking for help, there's nothing wrong with that.  

##### Will
I will work on this project a lot, not only to get a high grade, but also to learn a lot. I wwill also be availabe to help people out if they can't figure stuff out. Even if I don't exactly know what to do, having someone else look at the problem as well is a good way to solve it.

### Du Xiangyu

![xiangyudu](/doc/img/xiangyudu.jpg "xiangyudu")   
#### Personal development plan
First and foremost, I am good at writing report including project plan, java program features, personal experiences during the project etc. more specifically, setting up the report structure. I am also a good communicator and listener in the team. Besides that, I can do tasks more efficiently with high quality, e.g. writing java programs, under pressure and limited time though that is not recommended for a group project. In my last project in previous school, I completed writing programs with the same amount as other’s did but spent nearly three weeks less only because I started working on my part late. 
However, like I mentioned, this can also be an obstacle for both me and my team, which slows down the progress of the project. Besides that, I am not really good at backend development such as setting up the connection between server and client. Although I am willing to learn, it always costs me much more time than I expected and should spend on.     

##### Goals
One of the most important things that I would like to learn for the project is to cooperate better with my team members since it’s a team of 7 students while there was only 4 in my previous project. For achieving that, I will respect team members and try to communicate more with them. In addition, regarding java, I would like to learn more about server and client stuff and improve my program skills such as writing clean code. The reason for that is knowing how to write nice and clean code is the basic skill for being a computer scientist. I wish that I can achieve the goals by the end of this project. But they still need to be improved in the long run. 

##### Reality
I am trying to communicate more with my team members to make sure that I won’t fall much back the progress. However, since we haven’t started designing our program and writing code, I cannot foresee if the second goal will go well. 

##### Options 
For the first goal, I have to be confident and not afraid of speaking wrong words so that I can establish relatively smooth communications between me and my group members. That’s the only option that comes out of my head. I don’t think anything is stopping me from achieving this since the biggest enemy is myself and I have to beat him to break the limits. Considering improving program skills, the only way is to practice more and think more since, if someone keeps programming without thinking through his mistakes and improvements to make his code look nice and clean, he will never learn.   

##### Will
As mentioned before, I will be more confident when communicating with group members start from now. Besides that, I will try to write more interesting programs during my free time and learn from other’s code which looks nicer than mine.
